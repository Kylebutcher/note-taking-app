# Note Taker App

## Description

This is a note taking app that has a nice home page. To use the app all you need to do is click on the blue 'get started' button and it will take you to another page for you to start your note taking entries. Once you are on the next page, there will be a big section for you to title your note as well as a big text box for you to enter everything that you need. Once the note is complete it will show up in the left hand column and will have all of your notes you made there. Once you are done with them you have the option to keep them there or you can click the red trash icon and remove them from your screen
